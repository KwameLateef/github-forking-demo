Today's date is June 12th, 2018. It's 9:42a and it's a beautiful day. If the Tigers have a game today, I hope that they win. They've had a hard season so far.
Downtown is exceptional today. The grass is a rich green, the wind is gentle matched with a cool temp. The dust is clearing from yesterday's assessment.
